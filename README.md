Building a website based of a figma
Cookware Website

peer review: Juan Heredia "Really good responisveness, it looks very similar to the figma with some exceptions: 
the navbar Buttons don't have the same hover effect.
On desktop and phone the review text doesnt stay on the middle of the imgage.
the SHOP NOW buttons don't havea hover effect.
on tablet and desktop the social media icons are to the side instead of below the input field, this is fixed on phone but the input field is below the extra info fections instead of on top (one way to fix this would be to use bootstrap on the footer and wrap the content in cols, since you can assign "order" to them you should be able to change the "order" in which they appear depending on the current display width)
